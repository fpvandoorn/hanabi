"""A smart hat guessing Hanabi player.

A strategy for 4 or 5 players which uses "hat guessing" to convey information
to all other players with a single clue. See doc_hat_player.md for a detailed
description of the strategy. The following table gives the approximate
percentages of this strategy reaching maximum score (over 10000 games).
Players | % (no variant) | % (rainbow)
